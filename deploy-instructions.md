# üö® CLOUDFLARE PAGES DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING

## Current Issue
Cloudflare Pages is not deploying updated files. Contact.html with Cal.com booking widget is not appearing on the live site.

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Cloudflare Dashboard
- Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
- Navigate: Pages ‚Üí optiscale360
- Check: Recent deployments (last 5 commits)

### 2. Recent Commits to Check
- `abfc8ba` - Disabled build script (TESTING)
- `6b8690d` - Complete contact.html replacement
- `bccec69` - Added booking.html
- `be32dc5` - Fixed build script
- `5d373b6` - Added test contact page

### 3. What to Look For

#### A. Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Success (green) - Deployment worked
- ‚ùå Failed (red) - Build errors
- ‚è≥ Building (orange) - In progress

#### B. Build Logs
Click on any deployment to see:
- Build command execution
- Error messages
- File processing

#### C. Settings Check
In Settings ‚Üí Builds & deployments:
- Repository: `vinodwork2025/optiscale360`
- Branch: `main`
- Build command: `node _build.js` (now disabled)
- Output directory: `.`

## Manual Fix Options

### Option 1: Force New Deployment
In Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click "Retry deployment" on latest
3. Or click "Create deployment" ‚Üí Connect to Git

### Option 2: Clear Cache
1. In Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Caching
2. Click "Purge Everything"
3. Wait 5 minutes, test again

### Option 3: Reconnect Repository
1. Settings ‚Üí Builds & deployments
2. Disconnect GitHub integration
3. Reconnect to repository
4. Redeploy

### Option 4: Alternative Deployment
If Cloudflare Pages fails completely:
1. Export site to Netlify
2. Use Vercel
3. Use GitHub Pages

## Current File Status

### ‚úÖ Local Files (CORRECT)
- `contact.html` - Has Cal.com booking widget
- All commits pushed to GitHub

### ‚ùå Deployed Site (WRONG)
- `https://optiscale360.pages.dev/contact.html` - Shows old form
- Not reflecting our changes

## Emergency Contact Page
If main deployment fails, we have:
- `/booking.html` - Dedicated Cal.com booking page
- `/contact-test.html` - Test version

## Next Steps
1. Check Cloudflare dashboard deployment status
2. If still failing after build script disable, investigate deeper
3. Consider alternative deployment platforms
4. Manual file upload if necessary
