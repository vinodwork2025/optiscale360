## Common Questions About OptiScale Advisors

### Q: What makes you different from other SEO agencies?
**A:** Three key differentiators: (1) AI search specialization—we optimize for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, not just Google, (2) Technical depth—our team includes developers who understand schema, JavaScript SEO, and complex technical challenges, (3) Transparent methodology—we share our strategies and educate your team rather than treating SEO as a "black box."

### Q: How long does it take to see SEO results?
**A:** Technical improvements can impact rankings within 2-4 weeks. Content and authority-building strategies typically show measurable results in 3-6 months. AI visibility improvements often happen faster (4-8 weeks) due to how AI models update. We provide monthly progress reports to track improvement trends.

### Q: Do you work with businesses in my industry?
**A:** We serve most industries including B2B SaaS, e-commerce, professional services, healthcare, education, and technology. We don't work with industries we ethically oppose (gambling, adult content, predatory lending). If you have a unique industry, we'll research and develop a custom strategy.

### Q: Can you guarantee #1 rankings?
**A:** No ethical SEO agency can guarantee specific rankings—search algorithms are too complex and competitive. We guarantee our effort, expertise, best practices, and transparent reporting. Our track record shows 87% of clients achieve page-1 rankings for target keywords within 6 months.

### Q: Do you require long-term contracts?
**A:** No. We offer month-to-month engagements with 30-day notice. We earn your continued business through results, not contractual obligations. Most clients stay with us 12-24+ months because they see consistent value.

### Q: How do you measure AI search visibility?
**A:** We use custom monitoring tools to track mentions in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini responses. We test branded queries, category queries, and problem-solution queries. We measure citation frequency, recommendation positioning, and entity recognition accuracy. Monthly reports include AI visibility scores alongside traditional SEO metrics.

### Q: Can you help with international SEO?
**A:** Yes. We implement hreflang tags, manage multi-language content strategies, optimize for regional search engines (Baidu, Yandex, Naver), and handle cultural localization considerations. We've successfully launched clients in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and emerging markets.
