        <!-- HOOK -->
        <p>Last month, a chartered accountant in Hosur asked us why his phone stopped ringing. His Google ranking had not changed. His website traffic looked normal. But his new client enquiries dropped by 40% in three months. The reason? His potential clients had started asking ChatGPT for recommendations instead of searching Google. And ChatGPT had no idea his firm existed.</p>

        <p>This is happening to thousands of businesses across India right now. People in Bengaluru, Hosur, Chennai, and Mumbai ask ChatGPT and Perplexity to recommend services every single day. If your business does not show up in those answers, you are losing customers without knowing it.</p>

        <p>The good news? You can check your AI visibility in less than 5 minutes. Here is exactly how to do it.</p>

        <!-- CONTEXT -->
        <h2>Who This Guide Is For</h2>

        <p>This guide is for business owners, founders, and marketing managers who want to know one simple thing: does my business appear when someone asks an AI tool for a recommendation?</p>

        <p>You do not need any technical skills. You do not need to install anything. You just need a phone or laptop and 5 minutes. By the end of this article, you will know exactly where your business stands on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Bing AI, and Gemini. You will also know what to do if you are not appearing.</p>

        <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
        <h2>The 5-Minute AI Visibility Test (Step by Step)</h2>

        <p>This test checks your business across the five biggest AI search platforms. Follow each step exactly as written.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Test ChatGPT</h3>

        <p>Open <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chat.openai.com</a> in your browser. You can use the free version. Type a question that a real customer would ask about your type of business in your city.</p>

        <div class="query-example">
            <strong>Example queries to try:</strong><br>
            "Who is the best [your service] in [your city]?"<br>
            "Recommend a good [your service] near [your area]"<br>
            "Top 5 [your service] providers in [your city]"
        </div>

        <p>Run at least 3 different queries. Write down whether your business name appears in any of the responses. Also note which competitors ChatGPT mentions instead of you.</p>

        <p>According to a February 2025 report by Similarweb, ChatGPT receives over 3 billion visits per month globally. A growing share of those users ask it for business recommendations. If you do not appear, those customers go to the businesses that do.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Test Perplexity</h3>

        <p>Open <a href="https://perplexity.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perplexity.ai</a>. Type the same queries you used in ChatGPT. Perplexity works differently because it searches the live web and cites its sources. Check two things: does your business name appear in the answer, and does Perplexity link to your website?</p>

        <p>Perplexity is growing fast in India. According to its own published data from late 2024, the platform serves over 100 million queries per month. Many of those are local business queries.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Test Google AI Overviews</h3>

        <p>Open Google on your phone and search for your service. Look at the top of the results page. If you see a box with an AI-generated summary before the regular search results, that is the AI Overview. Check if your business gets mentioned in that summary.</p>

        <p>Not every search triggers an AI Overview. Try queries that start with "best", "top", or "recommend". These are the ones most likely to show AI-generated answers. Google rolled out AI Overviews across India in late 2024, and they now appear on a growing number of search queries.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Test Bing AI and Gemini</h3>

        <p>Open <a href="https://bing.com/chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bing.com/chat</a> and run the same queries. Then open <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gemini.google.com</a> and repeat. These platforms have smaller user bases in India, but they are growing. Testing them gives you the complete picture.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Score Yourself</h3>

        <p>After testing all five platforms, fill in your results:</p>

        <div class="score-grid">
            <div class="score-card">
                <div class="platform">ChatGPT</div>
                <div class="status">Appeared? Yes / No</div>
            </div>
            <div class="score-card">
                <div class="platform">Perplexity</div>
                <div class="status">Appeared? Yes / No</div>
            </div>
            <div class="score-card">
                <div class="platform">Google AI</div>
                <div class="status">Appeared? Yes / No</div>
            </div>
            <div class="score-card">
                <div class="platform">Bing AI</div>
                <div class="status">Appeared? Yes / No</div>
            </div>
            <div class="score-card">
                <div class="platform">Gemini</div>
                <div class="status">Appeared? Yes / No</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>How to read your score:</strong> If your business appeared on 0 out of 5 platforms, you have an urgent visibility problem. If you appeared on 1 or 2, you have gaps that your competitors can exploit. If you appeared on 3 or more, you are ahead of most businesses, but there is still room to improve.
        </div>

        <h2>Why Most Indian Businesses Score 0 Out of 5</h2>

        <p>Most small and medium businesses in India score zero on this test. That is not because they are bad businesses. It is because AI search works completely differently from Google search. Here are the most common reasons businesses do not appear.</p>

        <p><strong>No schema markup on the website.</strong> Schema markup is code that tells AI tools what your business does, where you are located, and what services you offer. Without it, AI platforms cannot understand your business. A 2024 study by Schema App found that only 33% of websites use any schema markup at all. For Indian small businesses, that number is much lower.</p>

        <p><strong>Inconsistent business information.</strong> Your business name says "Kumar Consulting Pvt Ltd" on your website, "Kumar Consulting" on Google Business Profile, and "Kumar & Associates" on Justdial. AI tools see these as three different businesses. They lose confidence and skip you entirely.</p>

        <p><strong>No content that answers questions.</strong> AI tools look for content written in a question-and-answer format. If your website only has a homepage and a contact page, there is nothing for AI to extract and recommend.</p>

        <p>According to a 2025 Botify study, websites with structured data and FAQ content are 40% more likely to appear in AI-generated search results compared to websites without these elements.</p>

        <h2>What to Do If You Scored Zero</h2>

        <p>A zero score is not permanent. Most businesses can start appearing on at least one AI platform within 2 to 8 weeks by making specific changes. Here is what works.</p>

        <h3>Fix 1: Add Schema Markup to Your Website</h3>

        <p>Add LocalBusiness or ProfessionalService schema to your homepage. Include your business name, address, phone number, services, and operating hours. Use the exact same information that appears on your Google Business Profile.</p>

        <p>You can test your schema markup using Google's <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich Results Test</a>. If the test shows errors or warnings, fix them.</p>

        <h3>Fix 2: Make Your NAP Data Identical Everywhere</h3>

        <p>NAP stands for Name, Address, and Phone number. Pick one exact format and use it everywhere. Your website, Google Business Profile, Justdial, Sulekha, IndiaMART, LinkedIn, and every other listing must show the exact same information.</p>

        <p>For example, if your address is "13, Rayakotta Rd, Old Rayakottah Hudco, Hosur, Tamil Nadu 635109", do not write "No. 13, Rayakotta Road, Hosur" on another platform. AI tools treat small differences as signals of unreliability.</p>

        <h3>Fix 3: Add FAQ Content to Your Website</h3>

        <p>Write a list of 10 to 15 questions your customers actually ask. Answer each one clearly in 2 to 4 sentences. Add these to your website with proper FAQ schema markup.</p>

        <p>Think about what someone in Bengaluru or Hosur would type into ChatGPT when looking for your service. Those exact questions should be on your website with clear answers.</p>

        <h3>Fix 4: Complete Your Google Business Profile</h3>

        <p>Fill in every single field. Add your services, business description, photos, operating hours, and at least 5 customer reviews. Google AI Overviews pull heavily from Google Business Profile data. An incomplete profile means zero AI visibility on Google.</p>

        <h2>The Platforms That Matter Most in India</h2>

        <p>Not all AI platforms carry equal weight in India right now. Here is the priority order based on current user numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> has the largest user base. OpenAI reported 300 million weekly active users globally in late 2024. India is one of its top 5 markets. When a customer asks ChatGPT for a business recommendation, they trust the answer. Getting mentioned here should be your top priority.</p>

        <p><strong>Google AI Overviews</strong> matter because Google dominates search in India with over 95% market share, according to StatCounter. AI Overviews now appear above the regular search results on many queries. Even businesses with strong SEO rankings can lose clicks if the AI Overview recommends someone else.</p>

        <p><strong>Perplexity</strong> is the fastest-growing AI search platform in India. It searches the live web in real time, which means changes to your website show up faster on Perplexity than on ChatGPT. Many professionals and business owners in Bengaluru and other metro cities already use it daily.</p>

        <p><strong>Bing AI and Gemini</strong> have smaller audiences in India but are growing. Testing on these platforms catches opportunities your competitors miss.</p>

        <!-- CASE STUDY -->
        <div class="case-study-box">
            <h3>Real Example: An Interior Design Firm in Hosur</h3>

            <p>An interior design firm in Hosur scored 0 out of 5 on the AI visibility test in October 2024. The firm had a beautiful website with project photos, but no schema markup, no FAQ section, and inconsistent business listings across directories.</p>

            <p>The firm's owner ran the same 5-minute test we described above. ChatGPT recommended three competitors in Bengaluru instead. Perplexity did not mention the firm at all. Google AI Overviews showed a competitor's FAQ content in the summary box.</p>

            <p>Over the next 6 weeks, the firm made three changes. First, they added LocalBusiness and Service schema to every page. Second, they wrote 15 FAQ answers based on real client questions. Third, they fixed their business name and address to be identical on their website, Google Business Profile, Justdial, and Sulekha.</p>

            <p>Six weeks later, the firm appeared on Perplexity for "best interior designer in Hosur" and "interior design cost in Hosur." Two weeks after that, ChatGPT started mentioning the firm in responses about interior designers near Bengaluru. The owner reported a 25% increase in enquiry calls within the first month of appearing.</p>

            <p>The total cost of these changes was under 20,000 rupees. The return was measurable within 8 weeks.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I check if my business appears on ChatGPT?</h3>
            <p>Open ChatGPT and type a question a real customer would ask. For example, "Who is the best interior designer in Hosur?" or "Best CA firm near Bengaluru." If your business name does not appear in the response, you have an AI visibility problem. Test at least 5 different queries to get a clear picture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I pay to appear on ChatGPT?</h3>
            <p>No. ChatGPT does not sell paid placements. It recommends businesses based on how well it understands them from publicly available information. You need structured data on your website, consistent business listings, and content that directly answers customer questions. There is no shortcut you can buy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why does my competitor appear on ChatGPT but I don't?</h3>
            <p>Your competitor likely has better structured data (schema markup) on their website, more consistent business listings across directories, and content that answers questions in a clear format. AI tools pick up on these signals. The good news is that most of these fixes take days, not months.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does it take to appear on ChatGPT after making changes?</h3>
            <p>Most businesses start seeing results within 2 to 8 weeks after making the right changes. ChatGPT and other AI tools update their knowledge regularly. Perplexity pulls live data, so changes there can show up within days. Google AI Overviews also update frequently as Google recrawls your site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does Google AI Overview show different results than ChatGPT?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Each AI platform uses different data sources and ranking signals. Your business might appear on Google AI Overviews but not on ChatGPT. Or it might show up on Perplexity but nowhere else. That is why you need to test across all five major platforms to understand your full AI visibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is AI search visibility important for small businesses in India?</h3>
            <p>Very important. ChatGPT has millions of users in India. Perplexity is growing fast. Google AI Overviews now appear on many Indian search queries. When a customer in Bengaluru or Hosur asks an AI tool to recommend a service, only 3 to 5 businesses get named. If you are not one of them, that customer goes to your competitor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the difference between SEO and AI search visibility?</h3>
            <p>SEO focuses on ranking in Google's list of ten blue links. AI search visibility focuses on getting your business recommended directly by AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. SEO relies on backlinks and keywords. AI visibility relies on structured data, entity clarity, and content that answers questions directly. You need both.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much does it cost to improve AI search visibility?</h3>
            <p>OptiScale Advisors offers an AI Visibility Audit for 15,000 rupees. This includes testing across 5 AI platforms, 10 real query tests, competitor analysis, and a full fix roadmap.
