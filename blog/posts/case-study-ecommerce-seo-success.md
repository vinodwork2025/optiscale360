# Case Study: How We Increased Ecommerce Organic Traffic by 425% in 8 Months

When TechGear Pro approached us in June 2023, their ecommerce site was struggling despite having quality products and competitive prices. Their organic traffic had plateaued, and they were heavily dependent on expensive paid advertising to drive sales.

**The Challenge:** Transform a stagnant ecommerce site into an organic traffic powerhouse while maintaining profitability.

**The Result:** 425% increase in organic traffic, $2.1M in additional revenue, and a 67% reduction in customer acquisition costs.

## The Initial Situation

### Client Background
TechGear Pro is a mid-sized ecommerce retailer specializing in consumer electronics and accessories. With over 15,000 products in their catalog, they faced unique challenges in organizing and optimizing their vast inventory for search engines.

### Key Problems Identified

2. **Thin Product Descriptions**: Most products had manufacturer descriptions that were duplicated across hundreds of other sites
3. **Technical SEO Issues**: Page speed problems, mobile usability issues, and crawlability problems
4. **Limited Content Strategy**: No blog or educational content to capture informational searches
5. **Weak Internal Linking**: Products weren't strategically connected, missing opportunities for category dominance
