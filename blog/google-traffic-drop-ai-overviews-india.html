        <!-- HOOK -->
        <p>A restaurant owner in Hosur called us in November 2025. He had ranked on the first page of Google for "best biryani in Hosur" for three years straight. His SEO agency told him everything looked fine. His rankings had not dropped. His website had no technical errors. But his phone was ringing 30% less than the same month last year.</p>

        <p>He was not imagining it. His Google Search Console showed something strange. His impressions stayed almost the same. But his clicks fell off a cliff. People were still searching for his restaurant. They just stopped clicking through to his website.</p>

        <p>The reason was a two-sentence box sitting above all the search results on Google. And most business owners in India have no idea it exists.</p>

        <!-- CONTEXT -->
        <h2>What This Article Covers</h2>

        <p>This article explains why thousands of Indian businesses saw their Google traffic drop in 2025 even though their rankings did not change. The cause is a specific Google feature called AI Overviews. Most articles explaining this problem target American businesses. This one is written for Indian business owners who spent years building their Google presence and now watch their numbers fall without understanding why.</p>

        <p>By the end, you will know exactly what AI Overviews are, which types of pages lose the most traffic, which types stay safe, and what you can do to adapt.</p>

        <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
        <h2>What Are Google AI Overviews?</h2>

        <p>Google AI Overviews are AI-generated summaries that appear at the top of Google search results. When someone searches for something like "how to file GST returns online", Google now shows a box with a complete answer pulled from multiple websites. The user reads the answer right there on Google. They never click through to any website.</p>

        <p>Google started testing AI Overviews in the US in May 2023. They expanded globally in stages throughout 2024. By late 2024, they started appearing on Indian search queries in English. By early 2025, they showed up on Hindi and other regional language queries too.</p>

        <h2>The Numbers Tell the Story</h2>

        <div class="stat-grid">
            <div class="stat-card">
                <div class="number">44.4%</div>
                <div class="label">of Google queries now show AI Overviews</div>
                <div class="source">BrightEdge, September 2025</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-card">
                <div class="number">58%</div>
                <div class="label">reduction in clicks to websites</div>
                <div class="source">Ahrefs, February 2026</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-card">
                <div class="number">1.6B</div>
                <div class="label">monthly users see AI Overviews</div>
                <div class="source">Google, October 2025</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Read those numbers again. Nearly half of all Google searches now show an AI-generated answer before any website link. And when that box appears, almost 6 out of 10 people who would have clicked on a website just read the summary and leave.</p>

        <p>Google confirmed in October 2025 that over 1.6 billion users interact with AI Overviews every month. This is not a small experiment. This is the new default for how Google works.</p>

        <h2>What Changed in March 2025</h2>

        <p>March 2025 was the month everything shifted for Indian businesses. Google expanded AI Overviews to cover significantly more Indian search queries. Here is the timeline.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="date">May 2023</div>
            <p>Google launches AI Overviews (called SGE at the time) as a US-only experiment in Google Labs.</p>

            <div class="date">May 2024</div>

            <div class="date">August 2024</div>
            <p>Expansion to India, Japan, UK, Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil. English queries start showing AI Overviews in India.</p>

            <div class="date">October 2024</div>

            <p>BrightEdge reports AI Overviews appear on 44.4% of all Google queries globally. Click-through rates to websites continue falling.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If your traffic started dropping between March and June 2025, AI Overviews are almost certainly the cause.</p>

        <h2>Three Types of Pages Getting Hit Hardest</h2>

        <p>AI Overviews do not affect all pages equally. Some types of content lose far more traffic than others. Here are the three categories getting hit the hardest.</p>

        <div class="danger-box">
            <strong>1. Informational pages that answer simple questions.</strong> Pages like "What is GST registration?" or "How to apply for PAN card online" lose the most traffic. Google AI reads multiple sources and gives a complete answer in the Overview box. Nobody needs to click through. If your website depends on traffic from these types of queries, you are losing the most.
        </div>

        <div class="danger-box">
            <strong>2. How-to guides and step-by-step content.</strong> Google AI pulls steps from your guide, numbers them neatly, and shows them at the top of the results page. The user follows the steps right there on Google. Your page still ranks in position 1, but nobody visits it. A Semrush study from August 2025 found that how-to queries saw the steepest click-through rate decline at 64%.
        </div>

        <div class="danger-box">
            <strong>3. Comparison and "best of" list pages.</strong> Queries like "best accounting software for small business India" now get an AI-generated comparison table. Google pulls features, pricing, and ratings from multiple sources and builds its own table. The individual review websites lose significant traffic because the comparison happens on Google itself.
        </div>

        <h2>Three Types of Pages That Stay Mostly Safe</h2>

        <p>Not every page loses traffic. Some types of content actually hold up well because Google does not show AI Overviews on those queries. Here is where your traffic is likely safe.</p>

        <div class="safe-box">
            <strong>1. Transactional pages with purchase intent.</strong> Queries like "buy wireless headphones online" or "book hotel in Ooty" rarely trigger AI Overviews. Google wants to show shopping results and ads on these queries. If your business sells products or services directly, your e-commerce and booking pages are mostly protected.
        </div>

        <div class="safe-box">
            <strong>2. Local service queries with high urgency.</strong> "Plumber near me open now" or "emergency dentist Bengaluru" usually show the Google Maps pack, not an AI Overview. Google knows these users need to take action immediately, not read a summary. Local businesses with strong Google Business Profiles still get clicks from these queries.
        </div>

        <div class="safe-box">
            <strong>3. Brand name searches.</strong> When someone searches for your exact business name, Google usually shows your website, Google Business Profile, and social media links. No AI Overview. This means investing in brand awareness and reputation still drives direct traffic to your site.
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Hits Indian Small Businesses Hardest</h2>

        <p>Every article about this topic is written for American brands with American examples. But the reality is that Indian small businesses face a much tougher version of this problem. Here is why.</p>

        <p><strong>Most Indian small businesses built their entire strategy around Google organic traffic.</strong> They spent lakhs on SEO agencies. They published hundreds of blog posts. They fought for years to reach page one. And now the traffic from those hard-won rankings is disappearing without any change in their ranking position.</p>

        <p><strong>Indian businesses have smaller margins to absorb the hit.</strong> A CA firm in Hosur that loses 30% of its website enquiries feels it immediately. A restaurant owner in Bengaluru who depended on "best biryani near me" traffic has fewer customers walking in. These are not large companies that can absorb a revenue dip. Every lost lead matters.</p>

        <p><strong>Most Indian SEO agencies have not adapted.</strong> Ask your SEO agency what they are doing about AI Overviews. Most will not have an answer. They will tell you your rankings are fine because they are still reporting position numbers. But position 1 with a 58% click reduction is not the same position 1 you paid for.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>The uncomfortable truth:</strong> Your Google rankings did not drop. The value of those rankings dropped. Position 1 in 2023 got you 8 out of 10 clicks. Position 1 in 2026 gets you 3 out of 10 clicks on queries where AI Overviews appear. Same rank. Less than half the traffic.
        </div>

        <!-- CASE STUDY -->
        <div class="case-study-box">
            <h3>Real Example: A Tutoring Centre in Hosur</h3>

            <p>A tutoring centre in Hosur had built a strong Google presence over four years. They ranked on page one for "best tuition centre in Hosur", "maths tuition Hosur", and 15 other keywords. Their website generated 40 to 50 enquiry calls per month through Google organic traffic alone.</p>

            <p>Between April and September 2025, those calls dropped to 25 per month. The owner checked with his SEO agency. Rankings looked the same. The agency could not explain what happened.</p>

            <p>When we looked at his Google Search Console data, the pattern was clear. His impressions stayed steady at around 12,000 per month. But his clicks dropped from 900 to 380. His click-through rate fell from 7.5% to 3.2%. The reason was visible on the search results page: AI Overviews now appeared on 8 of his top 15 keywords.</p>

            <p>Queries like "how to improve maths marks for class 10" and "best study tips for board exams" now showed AI-generated answers at the top. Students and parents got their answer on Google without ever visiting his website.</p>

            <p>We helped him shift strategy. He stopped chasing informational keywords and focused his content on high-intent local queries like "maths tuition near Hosur bus stand" and "class 10 board exam coaching Hosur fees." He added LocalBusiness schema, FAQ schema, and detailed service pages with pricing. Within 10 weeks, his monthly enquiry calls recovered to 38. Different keywords, but real leads.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- BRAND MENTION (subtle, mid-article) -->
        <h2>What You Can Do About It</h2>

        <p>This situation is not hopeless. Businesses that adapt quickly will actually come out ahead because most of their competitors are still confused about what happened. Here are four specific actions that work.</p>

        <h3>1. Audit Your Keywords for AI Overview Exposure</h3>

        <p>Open Google Search Console. Export your top 50 keywords by clicks. Search each one on Google and check if an AI Overview appears. Mark each keyword as "AI Overview present" or "No AI Overview." This gives you a clear map of where your traffic is leaking.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what the <a href="/ai-visibility-audit">OptiScale AI Visibility Audit</a> checks across five platforms, with 10 real queries and screenshots for every result.</p>

        <h3>2. Shift Content Toward High-Intent Local Queries</h3>

        <p>Stop writing content that answers simple factual questions. AI Overviews will always beat you on "what is" and "how to" queries. Instead, create content around queries with purchase intent that include your city name.</p>

        <p>Instead of "what is interior design", write about "interior design cost in Hosur for 2BHK apartment." Instead of "how to choose a CA", write about "CA firms in Bengaluru that handle startup compliance." These queries show less AI Overview coverage because they require local, specific, current information that AI cannot easily summarise.</p>

        <h3>3. Get Cited Inside the AI Overview</h3>

        <p>When AI Overviews appear, they cite sources. Small links appear below the AI-generated text. If Google cites your website as a source, you still get some traffic. Websites with strong structured data, clear factual content, and high domain authority are more likely to get cited.</p>

        <p>Add schema markup to every important page. Write content with clear, direct answers in the first paragraph. Use statistics and specific data points that AI can extract and attribute to you.</p>

        <h3>4. Build Traffic Sources Beyond Google</h3>

        <p>Depending entirely on Google organic traffic was always risky. Now it is dangerous. Start building visibility on AI search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity. Build your email list. Strengthen your Google Business Profile for local map pack results. Invest in referral partnerships.</p>

        <p>The businesses that treat Google as one traffic source among many will survive this shift. The ones that depend on Google alone will keep losing ground.</p>

    <!-- FAQ SECTION -->
    <section class="faq-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why did my Google traffic drop in 2025?</h3>
            <p>The most likely reason is Google AI Overviews. Google now shows AI-generated answers at the top of search results for 44% of queries. These answers give users the information they need without clicking through to your website. According to Ahrefs, AI Overviews reduce clicks to websites by 58% on average.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are Google AI Overviews?</h3>
            <p>Google AI Overviews are AI-generated summaries that appear at the top of Google search results. They pull information from multiple websites and give users a direct answer before the regular list of links. Google rolled them out globally in 2024 and expanded them across India in late 2024 and early 2025.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Which types of pages lose the most traffic from AI Overviews?</h3>
            <p>Three types of pages lose the most traffic. Informational pages that answer simple questions like "what is GST" lose the most because AI gives the answer directly. FAQ pages and how-to guides also lose heavily because AI summarises the steps. Service comparison pages lose traffic because AI creates its own comparison from multiple sources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are Indian business websites affected by Google AI Overviews?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Google AI Overviews now appear on Indian search queries in English, Hindi, and other regional languages. Indian small businesses that depend on Google organic traffic are seeing drops of 15% to 40% in clicks from search. This affects businesses in every city from Bengaluru and Mumbai to smaller towns like Hosur and Coimbatore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I get my website mentioned in Google AI Overviews?</h3>
            <p>Add structured data (schema markup) to your website so Google AI can understand your content. Write content that directly answers specific questions. Use FAQ sections with clear, short answers. Keep your Google Business Profile complete and accurate. Google AI Overviews pull from websites that provide clear, structured, authoritative information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is SEO dead because of AI Overviews?</h3>
            <p>SEO is not dead. But the rules changed. Traditional SEO focused on ranking in the list of ten blue links. Now you also need to optimise for AI-generated answers. Businesses that add schema markup, write question-based content, and maintain strong entity signals will keep getting traffic. The ones that only chase keyword rankings will lose ground.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will my Google traffic come back on its own?</h3>
            <p>No. AI Overviews are not going away. Google is expanding them, not reducing them. If your traffic dropped because of AI Overviews, it will not recover unless you make specific changes to your website. You need to adapt your content and technical setup so that your site either gets cited in AI Overviews or ranks for queries where AI Overviews do not appear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How can I check if AI Overviews are causing my traffic drop?</h3>
            <p>Open Google Search Console. Look at your top queries and check if impressions stayed the same but clicks dropped. Then search those queries on Google yourself and check if an AI Overview appears at the top. If you see AI Overviews on your top keywords and your click-through rate dropped, AI Overviews are the cause.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What queries are safe from AI Overviews?</h3>
            <p>Transactional queries like "buy wireless headphones online" rarely trigger AI Overviews because Google wants to show shopping results. Local queries with high purchase intent like "dentist near me open now" usually show the map pack instead. Brand searches like "Nike store Bengaluru" also tend to skip AI Overviews. Focus your SEO on these types of queries.</p>
