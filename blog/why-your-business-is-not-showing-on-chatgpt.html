    <article class="post-body">
        <p>You have probably searched for your own business on ChatGPT or Perplexity and found that it does not appear. Meanwhile, your competitors show up. This is not random — there are specific, fixable reasons why AI search engines ignore some businesses and recommend others.</p>

        <p>Here are the seven most common reasons, and what to do about each one.</p>

        <h2>Reason 1: No Schema Markup on Your Website</h2>
        <p>Schema markup (also called structured data or JSON-LD) is how you tell AI engines exactly what your business does, where it is located, what services you offer, and how much they cost. Without schema, AI has to guess — and it usually skips businesses it cannot understand clearly.</p>
        <div class="fix-box"><strong>Fix:</strong> Add LocalBusiness or ProfessionalService JSON-LD schema to your homepage with your name, address, phone, services, and pricing. Add Service schema to each service page. Add FAQPage schema to any page with an FAQ section.</div>

        <h2>Reason 2: Thin Content on Service Pages</h2>
        <p>If your service pages have only a headline, a few bullet points, and a contact form, AI engines cannot extract enough information to recommend you. They need detailed, specific content that answers the questions potential customers are asking.</p>
        <div class="fix-box"><strong>Fix:</strong> Expand each service page to at least 500 words. Describe what the service includes, who it is for, how the process works, what the pricing is, and what results to expect. Write it in plain language, not marketing jargon.</div>

        <h2>Reason 3: No FAQ Sections</h2>
        <p>AI search queries are questions. "Who is the best CA firm in Bengaluru?" "How much does an interior designer charge?" If your website does not have content that directly answers these types of questions, AI has no reason to cite you.</p>
        <div class="fix-box"><strong>Fix:</strong> Add FAQ sections to your homepage and each service page with 5-10 real questions your customers ask. Write thorough, helpful answers (not one-line responses). Add FAQPage schema markup to these sections.</div>

        <h2>Reason 4: Inconsistent NAP Data</h2>
        <p>NAP stands for Name, Address, and Phone number. If your business name is "ABC Consulting Pvt Ltd" on your website, "ABC Consulting" on Google Business Profile, and "ABC Consulting Services" on Justdial, AI engines lose confidence in your data. They cannot be sure all three listings refer to the same business.</p>
        <div class="fix-box"><strong>Fix:</strong> Choose one exact format for your business name, address, and phone number. Use it identically everywhere — website, Google Business Profile, Justdial, Sulekha, IndiaMART, social media profiles, and any directory listing.</div>

        <h2>Reason 5: Incomplete Google Business Profile</h2>
        <p>Google Business Profile (GBP) is one of the most important data sources for AI engines. If your profile is missing categories, services, hours, photos, or has fewer than 5 reviews, AI engines treat your business as less established and less trustworthy.</p>
        <div class="fix-box"><strong>Fix:</strong> Log into Google Business Profile and fill in every field. Add your primary and secondary business categories. List all your services with descriptions. Add at least 10 photos. Respond to every review — positive and negative. Post updates regularly.</div>

        <h2>Reason 6: Slow Website</h2>
        <p>When AI engines crawl your website to gather information, a slow site signals poor quality. Google and other AI platforms deprioritise slow websites in their data gathering process. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, you are at a disadvantage.</p>
        <div class="fix-box"><strong>Fix:</strong> Test your site at pagespeed.web.dev. Compress images to WebP format. Remove unused CSS and JavaScript. Enable caching. Aim for a Performance score above 80 on both mobile and desktop.</div>

        <h2>Reason 7: No Authoritative Mentions</h2>
        <p>AI engines trust businesses that are mentioned on other reputable websites. If your business exists only on your own website and Google Business Profile, AI has limited evidence that you are a real, established business worth recommending.</p>
        <div class="fix-box"><strong>Fix:</strong> Get listed on relevant industry directories, local business associations, and chamber of commerce websites. Write guest articles for industry publications. Get mentioned in local news or business roundups. Each mention from a trusted source increases your AI visibility.</div>

        <h2>What to Do Next</h2>
        <p>Go through each of these seven reasons and honestly assess where your business stands. Most businesses have at least 3-4 of these problems. The good news is that every single one is fixable.</p>
