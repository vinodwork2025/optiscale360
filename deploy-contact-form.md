- Track conversion funnel from page visit to form submission
- Set up goals for successful form submissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Emails Not Sending**
```bash
# Check environment variables
curl -X GET https://optiscale360.pages.dev/api/contact
# Should return "Not Found" but function should be accessible

# Check Resend dashboard for API errors
# Verify domain verification status
```

**2. Form Submission Errors**
- Check browser network tab for 4xx/5xx errors
- Review function logs in Cloudflare dashboard
- Verify JSON payload format

**3. Email Delivery Issues**
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify recipient email addresses exist
- Review Resend delivery logs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View function logs (if using Wrangler CLI)
npx wrangler pages functions logs

# Test local development
npx wrangler pages dev .

# Check deployment status
npx wrangler pages deployment list
```

## Security Verification

- [x] âœ… API key stored as environment variable (not in code)
- [x] âœ… Input validation on all form fields
- [x] âœ… CORS properly configured
- [x] âœ… HTTPS enforced for all communications
- [x] âœ… No sensitive data in client-side code

## Performance Metrics

**Expected Performance:**
- Form submission: ~2-6 seconds total
- Function execution: ~100-200ms
- Email delivery: ~1-5 seconds
- Page load time: <2 seconds

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can quickly rollback:

1. **Revert to Previous Version**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Disable Function Temporarily**
   - Remove or rename `/functions/api/contact.js`
   - The form will fall back to client-side validation errors

3. **Emergency Contact Method**
   - Ensure phone number and direct email are prominently displayed
   - Consider adding a mailto: link as backup

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Deployment Successful When:**
- Form submits without errors
- Lead notification email received at `vinod@optiscale360.com`
- Acknowledgment email received by customer
- All validation tests pass
- Function logs show no errors
- Email delivery rate >95%

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Monitor for 24 hours** to ensure stability
2. **Collect feedback** from first few form submissions
3. **Set up alerts** for failed email deliveries
4. **Document any customizations** needed
5. **Train team** on lead management workflow
